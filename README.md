## 👋 Hello there! I'm a fullstack developer.

🎯 I specialize in both frontend and backend development, and I'm always eager to explore new technologies.

🎮 Outside of coding, I'm a huge fan of online video games – from MMOs to MOBAs, I’m all in!

💛 Favorite color: **Yellow** – bright, positive, and full of energy.

🍜 I love **all** Vietnamese food, but if I had to pick one favorite, it would be **Phở** – the soul of Vietnamese cuisine!

📫 Feel free to connect with me!
